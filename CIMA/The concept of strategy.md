# Strategy formulation

## Nature of strategic management

 ### The concept of strategy

Organisations exist to fulfil particular purposes or goals, but they usually have to do so in competition with other organisations. Competition may be for resources or customers, or for both.

The strategic management process is concerned with mapping out the organisation's future direction by devising and implementing strategies which will enhance the competitiveness of the organisation. There are many different approaches to strategic management but essentially they all have the aim of establishing the purpose of the organisation and guiding managers on how to implement strategies to achieve organisational goals.

‘Strategy is the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term. Which achieves advantage in a changing environment through its configuration of resources and competences with the aim of fulfilling stakeholder expectations.’

— Johnson et al. (2008).

‘The basic characteristic of the match an organisation achieves with its environment is called its strategy.’

— Hofer and Schendel (1978).

‘Corporate strategy is the pattern of major objectives, purposes and goals and essential policies or plans for achieving those goals, stated in such a way as to define what business the company is in or is to be in and the kind of company it is or is to be.’

— Andrews, cited in Lynch (2007).

‘Corporate strategy is concerned with an organisation’s basic direction for the future: its purpose, its ambitions, its resources and how it interacts with the world in which it operates.’

— Lynch (2007).

CIMA TERMINOLOGY

A strategy is a course of action, including the specification of resources required, to achieve a specific objective.

CIMA TERMINOLOGY

A strategic plan is a statement of long-term goals along with a definition of the strategies and policies which will ensure achievement of these goals.

 Common themes in strategy

From its different definitions, strategy is concerned with:

- the purpose and long-term direction of the organisation.
- the scope of an organisation's activities and actions required to meet its objectives (broad or narrow).
- meeting the challenges from the organisation's external environment, such as competitors and the changing needs of customers.
- using the organisation's internal resources and competencies effectively and building on its strengths to meet environmental challenges.
- delivering value to the people who depend on the organisation, its stakeholders, such as customers and shareholders, to achieve competitive advantage.

Mintzberg et al attempted to define strategic management. They suggested five essential characteristics of strategic planning, known as the 5Ps:

- Plan
- Pattern
- Ploy
- Position
- Perspective

Whatever interpretation is put on strategy, the strategic actions of an organisation will have widespread and long-term consequences for the position of the organisation in the marketplace, its relationship with different stakeholders, and overall performance.

 Levels of strategy

Strategy occurs at different levels in the organisation. Consider a simplified model of the hierarchy at which different strategies are made. At the top of the hierarchy is where corporate strategy is made; this provides the framework for the development of business strategy, which in turn provides the framework for functional strategies. The different levels of strategy formulation are therefore interdependent in that one level should be consistent with the next.

 Corporate strategy

The corporate centre is at the apex of the organisation. It is the head office of the organisation and will contain the corporate board. The planning view of strategy assumes that all strategy was formulated at corporate level and then implemented in a 'top-down' manner by instructions to the business divisions. During the 1980s, high-profile corporate planners like IBM, General Motors and Ford ran into difficulties against newer and smaller 'upstart' competitors who seemed to be more flexible and entrepreneurial. One consequence was the **devolution** of responsibility for competitive strategy to strategic business units (SBUs).

**Corporate strategy** today typically restricts itself to determining the overall purpose and scope of the organisation. Common issues at this level include:

- decisions on acquisitions, mergers and sell-offs or closure of business units.
- conduct of relations with key external stakeholders such as investors, the government and regulatory bodies.
- decisions to enter new markets or embrace new technologies (sometimes termed **diversification strategies**).
- development of corporate policies on issues such as public image, employment practices or information systems.

 Business strategy

Management of the SBU will be responsible for winning customers and beating rivals in its particular market. Consequently, it is at this level that **competitive strategy** is usually formulated. The considerations at this level will include:

- marketing issues such as product development, pricing, promotion and distribution.
- decisions on production technology.
- staffing decisions.

A business strategy should be formulated within the broad framework of the overall objectives laid down by the corporate centre to ensure that each SBU plays its part. The extent to which the management of the SBU is free to make competitive strategy decisions varies from organisation to organisation and reflects the degree of **centralisation** versus **decentralisation** in the management structure of the firm.

CIMA TERMINOLOGY

A strategic business unit is a section, usually a division, within a larger organisation, that has a significant degree of autonomy, typically being responsible for developing and marketing its own products or services.

 Functional strategy

The functional (or sometimes called **operational**) level of the organisation refers to main business functions such as sales, production, purchasing, human resources and finance. Functional strategies are the long-term management policies of these functional areas. They are intended to ensure that the functional area plays its part in helping the SBU achieve the goals of its business strategy.
