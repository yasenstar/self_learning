# Tool for Personal Journaling and Diary

Learnt 17 open source tools from https://medevel.com/17-os-journaling-system/#:~:text=In%20this%20article,%20we%20listed%20the#:~:text=In%20this%20article,%20we%20listed%20the

I've digested following four for experiencing, starting from "Mini Diary", will keep eyes on other 3 good candidates. My primary expectation is find one that first work in desktop then mobile.

## MiniDiary

[Mini Diary](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/mini-diary) is a nifty, simple journal app. However, it is not maintained anymore, yet has many contributors and users.

Mini Diary is built using React and uses Electron for building desktop editions.

It comes with an easy-to-use interface that includes search, a note editor with a simple WYSIWYG, a calendar and a word counter.

## Journée

[Journée](https://adueck.github.io/journee/) is a simple journaling desktop application with a clean and clutter-free interface.

The program is released under Apache 2.0 License and is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Laverna

[Laverna](https://laverna.cc/) is a free, open-source note-taking app with a distraction-free mode. What makes Laverna different is that it supports tasks, code/ syntax highlighting, import/ export and user-friendly keybindings.

Laverna is available for the desktop (macOS, Windows, and Linux) and web as a "self-hosted" edition.

## TiddlyWiki

[TiddlyWiki](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyDesktop/releases) is this post author's personal favorite choice, as it is one compact HTML file with many features and customization options.

TiddlyWiki has a built-in journaling system, full-text search support, tagging options, Wiki-syntax text, and dozens of themes, plugins, languages support.

I highly recommend it for developers, researchers, and software engineers, as it is easy to re-shape according to the user's requirements.
