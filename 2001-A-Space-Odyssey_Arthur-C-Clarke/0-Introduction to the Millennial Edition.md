This entry records my hope that the novel was now essentially complete; in fact, all we had was merely a rough draft of the first two thirds, stopping at the most exciting  point -- because we hadn't the faintest idea what would happen next. But is was enough to let Stanley set up the deal with MGM and Cinerama for what was originally trumpeted as _Journey Beyond the Stars_. (Another variant: _How the Solar System Was Won_. Not a bad title -- and the time may now be ripe for it. But don't call me, and I won't call you.)

Considering its complex and agonizing gestation, it is not surprising that the novel differs from the movie in several respects. Most important --and how lucky this was we could never have guessed at the time -- Stanley decided to rendezvous with Jupiter, whereas in the novel the spaceship _Discovery_ flew on to Saturn, using Jupiter's gravitational field to boost it on its way.

Precisely this "perturbation maneuver _摄动策略_" was used by the Voyager spacecraft eleven years later.

And I haven't quite finished. Just about the time Joe was doing all this, I received a copy of his beautiful book _Entering Space: An Astronaut's Odyssey_ with a covering letter which read: " Dear Authur, When I was a boy, you infected me with both the writing bug _and_ the space bug, but neglected to tell how difficult either undertaking can be."
