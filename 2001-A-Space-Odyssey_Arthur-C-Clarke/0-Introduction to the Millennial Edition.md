# Introduction to the Millennial Edition

...

This entry records my hope that the novel was now essentially complete; in fact, all we had was merely a rough draft of the first two thirds, stopping at the most exciting  point -- because we hadn't the faintest idea what would happen next. But is was enough to let Stanley set up the deal with MGM and Cinerama for what was originally trumpeted as _Journey Beyond the Stars_. (Another variant: _How the Solar System Was Won_. Not a bad title -- and the time may now be ripe for it. But don't call me, and I won't call you.)
