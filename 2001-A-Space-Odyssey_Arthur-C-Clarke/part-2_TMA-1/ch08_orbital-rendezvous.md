# Orbital Rendezvous (会合)

...

From the central transit chamber he followed Miller down a curving stair. At first his weight was to slight that he had almost to force himself downward by holding on to the handrail. Not until he reached the passenger lounge, on the outer skin of the great revolving disk, had he acquired enough weight to move around almost normally.

The lounge had been redecorated since his last visit, and had acquired several new facilities. Besides the usual chairs, small tables, restaurant, and post office there were now a barber shop, drugstore, movie theater, and a souvenir shop selling photographs and slides of lunar and planetary landscapes, guaranteed genuine pieces of Luniks, Rangers, and Surveyors, all neatly mounted in plastic, and exorbitantly priced.

"Can I get you anything while we're waiting?" Miller asked, "We board in about thirty minutes."

"I could do with a cup of black coffee -- two lumps -- and I'd like to call Earth."

"Right, Doctor -- I'll get the coffee -- the phones are over there."

The picturesque booths were only a few yards from a barrier with two entrances labeled $WELCOME TO THE U.S. SECTION$ and $WELCOME TO THE SOVIET SECTION$. Beneath these were notices which read, in English, Russian, and Chinese, French, German, and Spanish:



<div style="text-align: center">
    PLEASE HAVE READY YOUR:<br>
    Passport<br>
    Visa<br>
    Medical Certificate<br>
    Transportation Permit<br>
    Weight Declaration
</div>



There was a rather pleasant symbolism about the fact that as soon as they had passed through the barriers, in either direction, passengers were free to mix again. The division was purely for administrative purposes.

Floyd, after checking that the area code for the United States was still 81, punched his twelve-digit home number, dropped his plastic all-purpose credit card into the pay slot, and was through in thirty seconds.

Washington was still sleeping, for it was several hours to dawn, but he would not disturb anyone. His housekeeper would get the message from the recorder as soon as she awoke.

"Miss Flemming -- this is Dr. Floyd. Sorry I had to leave in such a hurry. Would you please call my office and ask them to collect the care -- it's at Dulles Airport and the key is with Mr. Bailey, Senior Flight Control Officer. Next, will you call the Chevy Chase Country Club, and leave a message for the secretary. I definitely _won't_ be able to play in the tennis tournament next weekend. Give my apologies -- I'm afraid they were counting on me. Then call Downtown Electronics and tell them that if the video in my study isn't fixed by -- oh, Wednesday -- they can take the damn thing back." He paused for breath, and tried to think of any other crises or problems that might arise during the days ahead.

"If you run short of cash, speak to the office; they can get urgent messages to me, but I may be too busy to answer. Give my love to the children, and say I'll be back as soon as I can. Oh, hell -- here's someone I don't want to see -- I'll call from the Moon if I can -- good-bye."

Floyd tried to duck out of the booth, but it was too late; he had already been spotted. Bearing down to him through the Soviet Section exit was Dr. Dimitri Moisevitch, of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science.

Dimitri was one of Floyd's best friends; and for that very reason, he was the last person he wished to talk to, here and now.
