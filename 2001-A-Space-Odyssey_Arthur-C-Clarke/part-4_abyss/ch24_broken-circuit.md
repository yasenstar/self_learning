# Broken Circuit

… …

"I don't understand it, Hal. _Two_ units can't blow in a couple of days."

"It does seem strange, Dave. But I assure you there is an impending failure."

"Let me see the tracking alignment display."

He knews perfectly well that this would prove nothing, but he wanted time to think. The expected report from Missioin Control had still not arrived; this might be the moment to do a little tactful probing.

There was the familiar view of Earth, now waxing past the halfmoon phase as it swept toward the far side of the Sun and began to turn its full daylight face toward them. It was perfectly centered on the cross-wires; the thin pencil of the beam still linked _Discovery_ to her world of origin. As, of course, Bowman knew it must do. If there had been any break in communication, the alarm would already have sounded.

"Have you any idea," he said, "what's causing the fault?"

It was unusual for Hal to pause so long. Then he answered.

"Not really, Dave. As I reported earlier, I can't localize the trouble."

"You're quite certain," said Bowman cautiously, "that you haven't made a mistake? You know that we tested the other AE-35 unit thoroughly, and there was nothing wrong with it."

"Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that there is a fault. If it's not int he unit, it may be in the entire subsystem."

Bowman drammed his fingers on the conole. Yes, that was possible, though it might be very difficult to prove – untile a breakdown actually occurred and pinpointed the trouble.

"Well, I'll report it to Mission Control and we'll see what they advise." He paused, but there was no reaction.

"Hal," he continued, "is something bothering you – something that might account for this problem?"

Again there was that unusual delay. Then Hal answered, in his normal tone of voice:

"Look, Dave, I know you're trying to be helpful. But the fault is either in the antenna system – or in _your_ test procedures. My information processing is perfectly normal. If you check my record, you'll find it completely free from error."

"I know all about your service record, Hal – but that doesn't prove you're right this time. Anyone can make mistakes."

"I don't want to insist on it, Dave, but I am incapable of making an error."

There was no safe answer to that; Bowman gave up the argument.

"All right, Hal," he said, rather hastily. "I understand your point of view. We'll leave it at that."

He felt like adding "and please forgot the whole matter." But that, of course, was the one thing that Hal could never do.

If was unusual… …

It was a commonplace situation, familiar to every householder. One does not replace a blown fuse – until one knows just _why_ it has blown.
