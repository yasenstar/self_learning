# Cruise Mode

The day-by-day running of the ship had been planned with great care, and – theoretically at least – Bowman and Poole knew what they would be doing at every moment of the twenty-four hours. They operated on a twelve-hours-on, twelve-hours-off basis, taking charge alternately, and never being both asleep at the same time. The officer on duty remained on th control deck, while his deputy saw to the general housekeeping, inspected the ship, coped with the odd jobs that constantly arose, or relaxed in his cubicle.

Although Brwman was nominal Captain on this phase of the mission, no outside observer could have deduced the fact. He and Poole switched roles, rank, and responsibilitie completely every twleve hours. This kept them both at peak training, minimized the chances of friction, and helped toward the goal of 100 percent redundancy.

Bowman's day bagan at 0600, ship's time – the Universal Ephemeris Time of the astronomers. I f he was late, Hal had a variety of beeps and chimes to remind him of his duty, but they had never been used. As a test, Poole had once switched off the alarm; Bowman had still risen automatically at the right time.

His first official act of the day would be to advance the Master Hibernation Timer twelve hours. If this operation was missed twice in a row, Hal would assume that both he and Poole had been incapacitated, and would take the necessary emergency action.

Bowman would attend to his toilet, and do his isometric exercises, before settling down to breakfast and the morning's ratio-fax edition of the $World Times$. On Earth, he never read the paper as carefully as he did now; even the smallest items of sociaty gossip, the most fleeting political rumors, seemed of absorbing interest as they flashed across the screen.

At 0700 he would officially relieve Poole on the Control Deck, brining him a squeeze-tube of coffee from the kitcken. If – as was usually the case – there was nothing to report and no action to be taken, he would settle down to check all the instrument readings, and would run through a series of testsdesigned to spot possible malfunctions. By 1000 this would be finished, and he would start on a study period.
