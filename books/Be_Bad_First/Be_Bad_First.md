## Chapter 1 The New Need to Learn - and Our Mixed Response

1. How criticl it is for you to become a skilled and fluent acquirer of new knowledge and skills in order to succeed in this century?
2. How deeply we can each resist the necessary "novice" state that accompanies any truely new learning?

## Chapter 3 Cracking the Code: Michelangelo and ANEW

Important Question:

_How can I learn to do new things quickly and well -- especially things I've never done before and am not even sure how to go about learning?_

Four skills of mastery --

1. Aspiration
2. Neutral Self-Awareness
3. Endless Curiosity
4. Willingness to be Bad First

### Aspiration

Aspiration is wanting something you don't now have.

It is essential truth need to be recognized about human beings: we only do those things we want to do.

Be accurate here: if you say you want to do something, and yet you don't do it, then that means you don't really want to do it. At least not enough to make the effort required.

It is critical to be honest with yourself about your initial level of aspiration around learning a topic, so that you'll know what you need to do in order to succeed.

Self Assessment: assume that whether you think you want to learn something or you think you don't -- if you've been thinking about it for a while and haven't made the effort to learn it, you actually don't want to learn it that much. __You lack sufficient aspiration!__

The good news, however,it that aspiration is not a given; you can _make yourself want to do things_, including wanting to learn new things.

### Neutral Self-Awareness

When masters of mastery embark on new learning, they are accurate about where they're starting from, and they observe themselves and their strengths and weaknesses in a fair and dispassionate way. That's what we mean by neutral self-awareness.

Great learners are what we call "fair witnesses" of themselves.

What get in the way of accurate self-perception? The main problem is that we talk _to_ ourselves _about_ ourselves in ways that aren't accurate or helpful. We call that internal monologue "self-talk", and it's key to the way we see ourselves.

The good news is that you can manage your self-talk. You can learn to speak to yourself in ways that will allow you to see yourself clearly, and therefore position yourself to be a high-payoff learner.

### Endless Curiosity

Curiosity is the impulse to explore and explain, to understand and master. It is built into all of us as children -- and great learners either never lose that childhood drive, or they figure out hwo to reengage it as adults.

Getting __curious__ is essential to learning because, when combined with __aspiration__, it creates an unstoppable momentum of discovery.

Curiosity is the engine of learning that takes us from being a cute little blob at birth to a pretty much fully fledged human being by the time we're ready to start school -- someone who can walk, talk, eat, run, negotiate, make jokes, manipulate objects (and parents), speculate, and draw conclusions.

Aspiration supplies long-term motivation, whiule curiosity is moment to moment.

Aspiration makes you find a mentor; curiosity keeps you up till midnight reading the book she give you.

As with aspiration, you can make yourself curious -- and most people don't realize that.

As with aspiration, you can learn to reengage your own curiosity, to become curious about things you need to learn, and also to reestablish a more curious habit of mind overall, which will serve you every day of your life.

### Willingness to be Bad First

Most of us really dislike going back to the novice state -- especially in areas where we consider ourselves experts -- and we will go to great lengths to avoid being bad, looking bad, or thinking that we're bad.

The willingness to be bad first, to spend time in the "novice state," is the most potentially powerful capability you can develop as a learner.

### Before Moving...

Two Learning Opportunities to Find Out:

1. What's one thing that you're excited about learning -- something you want to learn? (Ideally, this would be something you've already started learning, since that's your best indication that you really do want to learn it!)
2. What's one thing that you know you need to learn, but that you don't want to learn? (This can be something that you already know you don't want to learn. It can also be something that you think or say you want to learn...but that you haven't yet been able to make consistent effort to learn.)

Some questions should ask to self --

1. Are you starting to want to explore these ideas?
2. Are you a little clearer about where your growth areas might be?
3. Are you wondering what's next?
4. Are you acknowledging that you might not be as good as learning new things as you'd like to be?

## Chapter 4 Aspiration: Ya Gotta Wanna

Wanting and Not Wanting, below are two false assumptions --

- Saying We Want What We Don't (Really)
  - We often confuse _being interested in the possibility_ of something with actually _wanting to achieve it_.
- Saying We Don't Want to When We Do (Kind Of)
  - When we do something we don't want to do very much, it is because we see it (usually without consciously thingking this through) as the best option avaiable; we believe we'll gain something important (or avoid something bad) by doing it.
- So: We Do What We Want Most
  - _We only do those things that we want to do more than any other option that's available to us in a given situation._

To make yourself want to learn something:

- Imagine the personal benefits to you of learning it
- Envision a "possible world" where you're enjoying those benefits

When we do anything that requires effort, we do it because we see clearly how it will benefit us, and we imagiune the future where we're reaping those benefits.

Getting clearer about the benefits that are most important to you is valuable in 2 ways:

1. It gives you a better sense of how you're wired aspirationally -- what's likely to be motivating to you in any situation;
2. Thinking through how you might gain some of these same benefits in those areas helps you break the unhelpful cycle of thinking only about the difficulties and obstackles.

## Chapter 5 Neutral Self-Awareness: The _American Idol_ Syndrome

To increase your neutral self-awareness:

- Manage your self-talk: Recognize --> Record --> Rethink --> Repeat
- Become your own fair witness
- Invite good "sources"

Neutral Self-Awareness starts when you gain more awareness and control over how you talk to yourself about yourself.

## Chapter 6 Endless Curiosity: Not Just Kid Stuff

True meaning of Curious, is _I'm so fascinated by how things work and what might be posible that I'm completely willing to do what it taks to find out more and become more skilled._ --> A deep and abiding _need to understand and master_.

To re-become Endlessly Curious:

- Find your own curiosity "sparks"
- Fan the flames with self-talk and action
- Feed the fire of curiosity daily

## Chapter 7 Willingness to Be Bad First: The Trap of Competence

To become willing to be bad first:

- Fully accept being not-good
- Believe in your ability to get good
- "Bridge" from what you're already good at

If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it wouldn't seem so wonderful at all.
