Important Question:

_How can I learn to do new things quickly and well -- especially things I've never done before and am not even sure how to go about learning?_

Four skills of mastery --

1. Aspiration
2. Neutral Self-Awareness
3. Endless Curiosity
4. Willingness to be Bad First

### Aspiration

Aspiration is wanting something you don't now have.

It is essential truth need to be recognized about human beings: we only do those things we want to do.

Be accurate here: if you say you want to do something, and yet you don't do it, then that means you don't really want to do it. At least not enough to make the effort required.

It is critical to be honest with yourself about your initial level of aspiration around learning a topic, so that you'll know what you need to do in order to succeed.

Self Assessment: assume that whether you think you want to learn something or you think you don't -- if you've been thinking about it for a while and haven't made the effort to learn it, you actually don't want to learn it that much. __You lack sufficient aspiration!__

The good news, however,it that aspiration is not a given; you can _make yourself want to do things_, including wanting to learn new things.

### Neutral Self-Awareness

When masters of mastery embark on new learning, they are accurate about where they're starting from, and they observe themselves and their strengths and weaknesses in a fair and dispassionate way. That's what we mean by neutral self-awareness.

Great learners are what we call "fair witnesses" of themselves.

What get in the way of accurate self-perception? The main problem is that we talk _to_ ourselves _about_ ourselves in ways that aren't accurate or helpful. We call that internal monologue "self-talk", and it's key to the way we see ourselves.

The good news is that you can manage your self-talk. You can learn to speak to yourself in ways that will allow you to see yourself clearly, and therefore position yourself to be a high-payoff learner.

### Endless Curiosity

Curiosity is the impulse to explore and explain, to understand and master. It is built into all of us as children -- and great learners either never lose that childhood drive, or they figure out hwo to reengage it as adults.

Getting __curious__ is essential to learning because, when combined with __aspiration__, it creates an unstoppable momentum of discovery.

Curiosity is the engine of learning that takes us from being a cute little blob at birth to a pretty much fully fledged human being by the time we're ready to start school -- someone who can walk, talk, eat, run, negotiate, make jokes, manipulate objects (and parents), speculate, and draw conclusions.

Aspiration supplies long-term motivation, whiule curiosity is moment to moment.

Aspiration makes you find a mentor; curiosity keeps you up till midnight reading the book she give you.

As with aspiration, you can make yourself curious -- and most people don't realize that.

As with aspiration, you can learn to reengage your own curiosity, to become curious about things you need to learn, and also to reestablish a more curious habit of mind overall, which will serve you every day of your life.

### Willingness to be Bad First

Most of us really dislike going back to the novice state -- especially in areas where we consider ourselves experts -- and we will go to great lengths to avoid being bad, looking bad, or thinking that we're bad.

The willingness to be bad first, to spend time in the "novice state," is the most potentially powerful capability you can develop as a learner.
