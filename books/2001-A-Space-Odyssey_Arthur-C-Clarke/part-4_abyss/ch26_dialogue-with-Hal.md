# Dialogue with Hal

Nothing elase aboard _Discovery_ had changed. All systems were still functioning normally; the centrifuge (离心机) turned slowly on its axis, generating its imitation gravity; the hibernauts slept dreamlessly in their cubicles; the ship coasted on toward the goal from which nothing could deflect it, except the inconceivably remote chance of collision with an asteroid (小行星). And there were few asteroids indeed, out here far beyond the orbit of Jupiter.
