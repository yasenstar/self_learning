# The Eye of Japetus

When Bowman had first observed Japetus, that curious elliptical patch of brilliance had been partly in shadow, illuminated only by the light of Saturn. Now, as the moon moved slowly along its seventy-nine-day orbit, it was emerging into the full light of day.

As he watched it grow, and _Discovery_ rose more and more sluggishly toward her inevitable appointment, Bowman became aware of a disturbing obsession. He never mentioned it in his conversation – or, rather, his running commentaries – with Mission Control, because it might have seemed that he was already suffering from delusions.

Perhaps, indeed, he was; for he had half convinced himself that the bright ellipse set against the dark background of the satellite was a huge, empty eye, staring at him as he approached. It was an eye without a pupil, for nowhere could he see anything to mar its perfect blankness.

Not until the ship was only fifty thousand miles out, and Japetus was twice as large as Earth's familiar Moon, did he notice the tiny black dot at the exact center of the ellipse. But there was no time, then, for any detailed examination; the terminal maneuvers were already upon him.

For the last time, _Discovery_'s main driver released its energies. For the last time, the incandescent fury of dying atoms blazed among the moons of Saturn. To David Bowman, the far-off whisper and rising thrust of the jets brought a sense of pride – and of sadness. The superb engines had done their duty with flawless efficiency. They had brought the ship from Earth to Jupiter to Saturn; now this was the very last time that they would ever operate. When _Discovery_ had emptied her propellant tanks, she would be as helpless and inert as any comet or asteroid, a powerless prisoner of gravitation. Even when the rescue ship arrived a few years hence, it would not be an economical proposition to refuel her, so that she could fight her way back to Earth. She would be an eternal orbiting monument to the early days of planetary exploration.

The thousands of miles shrank to hundreds, and as they did so, the fuel gauges dropped swiftly toward zero. At the control panel, Bowman's eyes flickered anxiously, back and forth over the situation display, and the improvised charts which he now had to consult for any real-time decisions. It would be an appalling anticlimax if, having survived so much, he failed to make rendezvous through lack of a few pounds of fuel.…

The whistle of the jets faded, as the main thrust died and only the verniers continued to nudge _Discovery_ gently into orbit. Japetus was now a giant crescent that filled the sky; until this moment, Bowman had always thought of it as a tiny, insignificant object – as indeed it was compared with the world around which it circled. Now, as it loomed menacingly above him, it seemed enormous – a cosmic hammer poised to crush _Discovery_ like a nutshell.

Japetus was approaching so slowly that it scarcely seemed to move, and it was impossible to tell the eact moment when it make the subtle change from an astronomical body to a landscape, only fifty miles below. The faithful verniers gave their last spurts of thrust, then closed down forever. The ship was in its final orbit, completing one revolution every three hours at a mere eight hundred miles an hour --all the speed that was required in this feeble gravitational field.

_Discovery_ had become a satellite of a satellite.
