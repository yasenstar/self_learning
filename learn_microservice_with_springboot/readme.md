## book structure

This book focuses first on some basics about how to design and implement a production-design Spring Boot application using well-known architecture pattern (Chapter 2 and 3).

From there, it takes you through the journey of tools and frameworks related to microservices with the introduction of a second piece of functiohnality in a different Spring Boot app (Chapter 4 and 5).

It also shows you how to support such a distributed system with end-to-end integration tests (Chapter 6).

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

_AssertJ_ and _Mockito_ will serve us to build useful tests efficiently.

The test plan is like:

1. Create the tests first
2. Make them fail
3. Implement the logic to make them work
