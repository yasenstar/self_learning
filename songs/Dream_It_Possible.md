I will run, I will climb, I will soar

I'm undefeated

Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord

Yeah I believe it

The past, is everything we were don't make us who we are

So I'll dream, until I make it real, and all I see is stars

It's not until you fall that you fly

Where your dreams come alive you're unstopptable

Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful

We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold

And we'll dream it possible

Possible, Oh, and we'll dream it possible

I will chase, I will reach, I will fly

Until I'm breaking, until I'm breaking

Out of my cage, like a bird in the night

I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing

In, into something big, better than before

And if it takes, takes a thousand lives

Then it's worth fighting for

It's not until you fall that you fly

When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable

Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful

We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold

And we'll dream it possible

From the bottom to the top

We're sparking wild fire's

Never quit and never stop

The rest of our lives

From the bottom to the top

We're sparking wild fire's

Never quite and never stop

It's not until you fall that you fly

When your dreams comes alive you're unstopptable

Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful

We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold

And we'll dream it possible possible

And we'll dream it possible
