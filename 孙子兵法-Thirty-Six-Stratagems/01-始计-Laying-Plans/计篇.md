| 孙子曰：兵者，国之大事，死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也。                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |    |
| 故经之以五事，校之以计而索其情：一曰道，二曰天，三曰地，四曰将，五曰法。                    | The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |    |
| 道者，令民与上同意也，故可以与之死，可以与之生，而不畏危。                           | The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |    |
| 天者，阴阳、寒暑、时制也。                                           | Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |    |
| 地者，远近、险易、广狭、死生也。                                        | Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |    |
| 将者，智、信、仁、勇、严也。                                          | The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |    |
| 法者，曲制、官道、主用也。                                           | By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |    |
| 凡此五者，将莫不闻。知之者胜，不知者不胜                                    | These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |    |
| 故校之以计而索其情，曰：主孰有道？将孰有能？天地孰得？法令孰行？兵众孰强？士卒孰练？赏罚孰明？吾以此知胜负矣。 | Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise: - (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued  with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment? By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat. |    |
| 将听吾计，用之必胜，留之；将不听吾计，用之必败，去之。                             | The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat: - let such a one be dismissed!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |    |
| 计利以听，乃为之势，以佐其外。                                         | While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |    |
| 势者，因利而制权也。                                              | According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |    |
| 兵者，诡道也。                                                 | All warfare is based on deception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |    |
