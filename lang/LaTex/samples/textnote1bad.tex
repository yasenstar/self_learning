It is of some concern to me   that 
the terminology used in  multi-section
 math courses is not uniform.

In several sections of the course on 
matrix theory, the strange term   
 ``hamiltonian-reduced'' is used. 
  I, personally, would rather call these 
 ``hyper-simple''. I
invite others to comment on this  problem.
