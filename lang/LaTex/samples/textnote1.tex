It is of some concern to me   that 
the terminology used in  multi-section
 math courses is not uniform.

In several sections of the course on 
matrix theory, the  term   
 ``hamiltonian-reduced'' is used. 
 I, personally, would rather call these 
``hyper-simple''. I invite others 
 to comment on this  problem.
